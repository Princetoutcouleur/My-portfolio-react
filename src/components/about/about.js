            <p>
              I'm a UX/UI Designer based in Argentina. I'm focused on designing
              and developing user-friendly interfaces to offer the best product.
              I'm passionate about improving the lives of others through
              user-centered design.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have experience working in agile environments and have worked
              through the entire product development cycle, from ideation to
              delivery. I've worked as a freelancer to help clients design and
              build unique products that were visually strong, worked
              beautifully, were easy to use, but most importantly, focused on
              the user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm constantly looking to learn new things every day and looking
              for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge to better myself
              as a designer.
